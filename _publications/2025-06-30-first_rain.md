In September 2024, following a prolonged drought and widespread wildfires across Brazil, the first rainfall was forecasted in the southern region of the country. This study investigates the chemical composition of this rainwater. Rainwater samples were collected from 15 locations and analyzed using Total Reflection X-ray Fluorescence (TXRF) with a Bruker S2 Picofox system. The results revealed the presence of elements such as Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Br, Ba, and Sr. The highest concentrations were observed for Ca (425 mg/L), Cl (353 mg/L), Si (265 mg/L), K (150 mg/L), Fe (149 mg/L), and Al (119 mg/L). These findings highlight the relationship between environmental events, such as droughts and wildfires, and rainwater composition, emphasizing broader implications for air quality and water resources.
