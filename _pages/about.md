I'm João Marcos Lopes, a PhD Candidate in Physics at the State University of Londrina (UEL), specializing in **Applied Nuclear Physics**. My research focuses on soil redistribution assessment through **Gamma-Ray Spectrometry (GRS)**, **X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF)**, and **Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS)**. I am currently working with data fusion models to explore the synergy among these spectroscopic techniques, as well as applying geostatistical tools to analyze the spatial distribution of soil parameters and their relationship with erosion and movement processes.

I also have experience in **modeling and multivariate analysis** of spectral and quantitative data, using exploratory techniques to uncover patterns and relationships, as well as predictive models to interpret and make sense of complex datasets.

Recently, I have been working on **Bayesian calibration models** for XRF, applying orthogonal regression techniques that account for uncertainties in both measured and certified values. This approach improves accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to traditional least-squares calibration, offering a more robust representation of the relationship between signal and concentration.

I have also **collaborated on different research projects** that combine spectroscopic techniques with environmental and archaeological studies. I contributed extensively to a study analyzing the chemical composition of rainwater following extreme drought and wildfire events in southern Brazil, employing TXRF to characterize elemental concentrations across multiple locations. In another project on pottery sherds from the Ventarrón-Collud Archaeological Complex in Peru, I contributed with the GRS analyses, complementing other spectroscopic and mineralogical techniques applied to understand material composition and post-depositional processes.

For GRS, I have experience working with HPGe, NaI(Tl), and CZT detectors, and have developed **custom codes to convert raw spectral files into computer-friendly formats**, aiming to establish a more complete and flexible framework for data processing and analysis.

I have been an active member of the **Applied Nuclear Physics Group** at UEL since 2020. During my PhD, I spent a semester at the **International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA)**, as an STEP fellow, working alongside researchers at the **Nuclear Science and Instrumentation Laboratory (NSIL)** and the **Soil and Water Management and Crop Nutrition Laboratory (SWMCNL)**. 

I am currently interested in advancing the use of spectroscopic techniques in environmental and soil studies, with a focus on data analysis, data fusion, and modeling.
